## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to work with dates using JavaScript and how to handle situations like when the year entered by the user is a future year, as well as how to use JavaScript's Date (I didn't know how to deal with the issue of months having more or fewer days). The most challenging part was managing a huge number of conditional repetitions to indicate errors.
